<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a fourth year joint Ph.D. student in the [Image and Visual Representation Lab (IVRL)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ivrl/), the School of Computer and Communication Sciences at [√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Lausanne, Switzerland, luckily supervised by [Prof. Sabine S√ºsstrunk](https://people.epfl.ch/sabine.susstrunk?lang=en) and working with [Dr. Tong Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/tong-zhang).

Before that, I received my bachelor degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Beijing, China. My bachelor's thesis was supervised by [Prof. Hang Su](https://www.suhangss.me/) and [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml). And I feel lucky to further collaborate with [Prof. Hang Su](https://www.suhangss.me/), [Prof. Jianmin Li](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1154/3991.htm) and [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) from Tsinghua University.
I am also enrolled in a Ph.D. program at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/), Beijing, China, luckily supervised by [Prof. Shiming Ge](https://imsg.ac.cn/people/geshiming.html) and [Prof. Can Ma](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~macan).

Currently, my research focuses on Multimodal Media Forensics and AI Safety, including investigating the mechanism of generative models (such as Large Language Models and Diffusion Models) and how to detect generated or manipulated content.
If you are also interested in similar topics or seeking any form of research collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me by email. I always enjoy working with excellent researchers!
